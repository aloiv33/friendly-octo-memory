   Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm attempting to get comfortable using GitHub to expand my resources for learning, becoming involved with the community, and share projects.  My goals are to advance to a level that I am an asset to the community, and able to help others learn and prosper from gaining skills and knowledge.
